245;Elizabeth Opila;"Our research focuses on materials for use in extreme environments and can be applied to materials for use in aircraft engines, rocket engines, energy conversion technologies, and thermal protection systems.  We first create critical aspects of the use environment in the lab such as high temperatures (up to 2000°C), reactive gases (oxygen, water vapor), and high flow rates ( hundreds of meters per second). We characterize materials before and after exposure using techniques as simple as weight change to sophisticated state-of-the-art microscopies and spectroscopies.  Experiments are linked with theory and computational techniques where possible.  We ask these questions about material behavior:  What reactions occur and why?  How fast do they occur?  Can we predict material lifetimes?  How can we make better materials?";"Arthur L. Friedberg Award, Ceramic Engineering Tutorial and Lecture, American Ceramic Society

25;Kristen Naegle;"Kristen Naegle uses data- and computational-driven approaches to predict, and experimental approaches to test, the regulation and function of tyrosine phosphorylation in complex networks. Tyrosine phosphorylation is a protein modification that can occur during or after translation of a protein.The phosphate addition to a tyrosine residue, regulated by tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, can result in changes in protein function, regulation and localization. It is key to important cell signaling processes, which are the processes that convert extracellular cues, like growth factors and insulin, into biochemical networks that result in a change to the cell.  Tyrosine phosphorylation is specifically utilized in the early events of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) networks, which are fundamental to many processes in the development and homeostasis of complex organisms.  Improvements in measurement technologies have enabled the ability to detect and monitor tyrosine phosphorylation and now we know that tyrosine phosphorylation is extensive — occurring on thousands of tyrosines in the human proteome.";"Research Communications Fellow, UVA

Regardless of how much knowledgeable you are; you should transfer your information effectively in such a way that a student can understand it properly, without memorizing the material. I also believe that in order to be an effective teacher, you must be a lifelong learner and create that spirit in your students. I grew up in a teacher-based family. My father was a mathematics teacher and from my childhood, I always remember how he influenced my mind indirectly to have a passion for teaching. So, I was fortunate to gain a perspective on teaching in the early stages of my childhood. He always reminded me of how teaching is crucial for society and my mindset has been framed by a saying he often shared with me:” No matter what you are teaching, always be careful how you behave with your students. They are next-generation and whatever you teach will be reflected in your society.

220;Karina Rider;"Karina researches how people think about ""good work"" in the digital age. Trained as a sociologist, they use qualitative methods -- such as ethnography, interviews, and discourse/content analysis -- to get at how people critique technology and labor, and how they try to fix it. They are currently writing a book for MIT Press that explores what happens when high-status tech workers in Silicon Valley become disillusioned with their jobs. The manuscript follows a group of engineers and computer scientists who volunteer in their spare time to build technologies for municipal governments as they try to simultaneously design technologies that increase civic participation while also working through their disappointment with the tech industry. Many workers find themselves in a bind: they want to feel passionate about their jobs in Silicon Valley, but the industry continuously disappoints them; they want to build things that will help people, but they are pressured to make their employer as much money as possible. Tech workers' frustration with their situation leads them to get involved in Tech for Good initiatives as a way to salve their discontentment. But this has consequences for the kinds of technologies Tech for Good initiatives create: often, they end up building products nobody uses, rather than helping the communities the volunteers wanted to assist in the first place. In all, the book tells a complicated story about passionate labor and the limits of Tech for Good projects.";

Central to our efforts is a disruptive emerging platform technology called focused ultrasound (FUS) – which enables non-invasive, non-ionizing, and targeted deposition of acoustic energy into tumor tissues with high spatial precision. We are advancing applications of FUS for non-surgical tumor debulking, immuno-modulation and immunotherapy (e.g. therapeutic antibody, engineered T cell) delivery in highly complex and aggressive cancer settings, including metastatic breast cancer and brain tumors (high-grade gliomas, brain metastasis, pediatric brain tumors). Our lab also utilizes systems biology and imaging informatics approaches to integrate FUS with serial surveillance strategies like liquid biopsy (e.g. blood draws) and multimodality imaging (e.g. MRI, immuno-PET) to improve the precision, adaptability, and predictability of combinatorial cancer interventions. Our highly translational and multidisciplinary research group interfaces closely with multiple ongoing clinical trials at UVA that are evaluating FUS in aggressive cancer settings. As Research Director of UVA’s FUS Cancer Immunotherapy Center, Dr. Sheybani leads additional efforts beyond the lab to integrate and translate FUS immuno-oncology applications across UVA.";"International Society for Therapeutic Ultrasound “Rising Scientist in Therapeutic Ultrasound”

We have used the laser trap to study the movement of the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii. My lab was the first to measure the biomechanics and coordination of molecular motors inside a living cell.
